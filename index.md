### Berea College Fall 2023 Offering

---

## Reminder: Exam E1 will be Wednesday, October 11, 2023

## Day 19: Friday, October 6, 2023

### Day 19: In class

- Questions on [L4: The Game of War](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pFPUvSWkVjKE1b2Rsx3HvijuDqe0elcTesyrE3AaaH8)?
- Complete and submit [TR1: E1 Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKBUi_i1XsbP6Aidb5rqQifVveU4rQSpBK-pKVGy8Yc). Remember that it is up to each of you and your teams to help each other make it excellent. **Note that due to the nature of this assignment, it will not be accepted late.**

### Day 19: Outside of class

- For Monday (during Reading Period), complete and submit [L4: The Game of War](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pFPUvSWkVjKE1b2Rsx3HvijuDqe0elcTesyrE3AaaH8)
- For Wednesday study for exam E1 which is in class on Wednesday.
- For Friday read [Chapter 4 in our Data Structures textbook]
  - The E1 exam will ALL be on paper. It will be a mixture of multiple choice and short answer, and will have one full program that you have to write on paper, likely using OOP.
  - Exam E1 will cover all of the material from the course thus far, but the major topics covered thus far are C++, OOP, Big O, and linear structures stacks, queues, and deques. i.e. the major topics are C++, and the first three chapters of the textbook. Peerwise is very unlikely to suffice for your study unless you make the questions excellent.
- Read [Chapter 4 in our Data Structures textbook]
